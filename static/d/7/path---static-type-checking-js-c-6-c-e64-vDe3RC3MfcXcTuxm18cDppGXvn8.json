The last few years has seen a big rise in\nTypeScript and Flow usage, which add static type checking to JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Within an individual engineering team, it’s fairly difficult to determine the\nactual value (or cost) that one attains from switching from a dynamic\nto static typing system.</p>\n<p>A group of researchers created a study to estimate just this: do static\ntype systems improve software quality, and if so, by how much?</p>\n<p>This post summarizes the research published in <em><a href=\"http://ttendency.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/type_study/documents/type_study.pdf\">To Type or Not to Type:\nQuantifying Detectable Bugs in JavaScript</a></em>, by Gao et. al. IEEE 2017, with\nparticular attention on aspects of the paper applicable to software\nengineering teams using JavaScript or its typed variants.</p>\n<p>Result: 15% of sampled JavaScript bugs were detectable by Flow 0.30 and TypeScript 2.0.</p>\n<h2>Definition and methodology</h2>\n<p>The team classified a bug as <code class=\"language-text\">ts-detectable</code><sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> if using type annotations would\ncause the program containing the bug to error on a line changed by\na bug fix, and when the new type annotations are consistent with the fixed program.</p>\n<p>At the time of analysis (08/19/2015), there were 3,910,969 closed bug reports\non open-source JavaScript projects on GitHub. The authors wanted a 95% confidence\nlevel, and so sampled 400 bugs at random for the experiment.</p>\n<p>The researchers classified each bug as <code class=\"language-text\">ts-detectable</code> in each of TypeScript and Flow.\nFirst, they checked if the bug report was absolutely not type-related (for example,\nif the bug was due to a misunderstanding of the product specification), and if so they labeled\nit as undetectable. Next, they looked at the intended behavior of the bug fix and\nattempted to add annotations to cause the type system to error at the area of code patched\nby the bug fix. If they could do this, the sample was deemed <code class=\"language-text\">ts-detectable</code>; otherwise it was not.\nThe researchers also set a time-bound for each bug investigation to 10 minutes, after which\nthe bug was deemed unknown.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b9d2543172f4e4a8451901a241a9228f/68866/histo_tc_detectable.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 47.63888888888889%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"histo tc detectable\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/b9d2543172f4e4a8451901a241a9228f/6255c/histo_tc_detectable.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b9d2543172f4e4a8451901a241a9228f/375dc/histo_tc_detectable.png 148w,\n/static/b9d2543172f4e4a8451901a241a9228f/6b157/histo_tc_detectable.png 295w,\n/static/b9d2543172f4e4a8451901a241a9228f/6255c/histo_tc_detectable.png 590w,\n/static/b9d2543172f4e4a8451901a241a9228f/68866/histo_tc_detectable.png 720w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>The team was able to label all 400 bug samples: Each of Flow and TypeScript\ndetected 60 of the bugs. This means at the confidence level of 95%, the\npercentage of detectable bugs for each falls into [11.5%, 18.5%] with mean 15%.</p>\n<p>Most of the bugs were easy to determine: only 18 of the 400 hit the\ntime-box period of 10 minutes, mostly due to external modules and interfaces\nmaking it harder to isolate the source of the bug. The team spent more time on\nthese bugs, utilizing published type definitions and documentation\nwhen necessary, and were able to classify them all.</p>\n<h3>Caveats</h3>\n<p>The authors think this greatly understates the impact of static typing, because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They only surveyed publicly visible bugs, which means any bug caught during\ndevelopment was not included. They also think public bugs are more often cause\nby misunderstanding of the specification, which type systems cannot detect.</li>\n<li>These results do not include any other strengths of static type systems, like\ndeveloper efficiency or app performance.</li>\n<li>This experiment uses the relatively weak type systems of TypeScript and Flow.</li>\n<li>The authors have limited expertise in Flow and TypeScript, which means they\ncould have incorrectly deemed bug as undetectable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What about the undetectable bugs?</h3>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3779949d69c3eaadc128e1e353d1b495/68866/histo_undetectability.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 45.27777777777778%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"histo undetectability\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/3779949d69c3eaadc128e1e353d1b495/6255c/histo_undetectability.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3779949d69c3eaadc128e1e353d1b495/375dc/histo_undetectability.png 148w,\n/static/3779949d69c3eaadc128e1e353d1b495/6b157/histo_undetectability.png 295w,\n/static/3779949d69c3eaadc128e1e353d1b495/6255c/histo_undetectability.png 590w,\n/static/3779949d69c3eaadc128e1e353d1b495/68866/histo_undetectability.png 720w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>The vast majority of bugs that were undetectable were due to “specification errors”,\nwhich constituted 78% of total bugs. This is covered by <code class=\"language-text\">BranchError</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">PredError</code>,\n<code class=\"language-text\">UIError</code>, and the catch-all <code class=\"language-text\">SpecError</code> in the above histogram. This demonstrates\nthe importance of careful specification before development begins.</p>\n<p>The second most common error type was <code class=\"language-text\">StringError</code>, often due to a wrong URL.</p>\n<h3>Comparing TypeScript and Flow</h3>\n<p>While TypeScript and Flow had the same number of <code class=\"language-text\">ts-detectable</code> bugs, they\ndon’t have complete overlap. There were 3 bugs that were only detectable\non Flow, and 3 only on TypeScript.</p>\n<p>In all of the three bugs detectable in Flow but not TypeScript, the bug was a result of concatening\na possible undefined or null value with another string. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token string\">\" \"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">null</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token string\">\" \"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This highlights a TypeScript weakness, at least as of version 2.0, in its null handling.</p>\n<p>Two of the three bugs detectable in TypeScript but not Flow were due to Flow’s incomplete\nsupport for using string literals as an index.</p>\n<p>Also of note: of the 60 ts-detectable bugs, 22 of them needed null checks.\nThis is a feature added in TypeScript 2.0, and needs <code class=\"language-text\">--strictNullChecks</code> enabled.</p>\n<h2>Approximating the cost of using static typings</h2>\n<p>While it’s incredibly difficult to directly measure the effort for programmers\nto use a static type system, the authors tried to approximate this.</p>\n<p>They defined:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code class=\"language-text\">token tax</code>, which was the number of tokens in an annotation needed\nto trigger a type error for the bug in question. The goal for this was to proxy the number of decisions\na programmer would take when adding type annotations.</li>\n<li>A <code class=\"language-text\">time tax</code>, which was the time spent adding annotations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that these measures are an underestimate of the real-world cost, because they\nare calculated for a single bug in which the authors only used\ntype annotation to target the bug in question (and not the entire module).</p>\n<p>These metrics are only intended to track the incremental cost\nfor each potentially-bug-introducing change. If we assume an entire project\nis already using a static type checker, then the cost to a developer\nis only the time and tokens needed as part of their code change.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c7a4a9afe910c9d017d2ae8a816ca0f5/db618/annotation_tax.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 32.18085106382979%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"annotation tax\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/c7a4a9afe910c9d017d2ae8a816ca0f5/6255c/annotation_tax.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c7a4a9afe910c9d017d2ae8a816ca0f5/375dc/annotation_tax.png 148w,\n/static/c7a4a9afe910c9d017d2ae8a816ca0f5/6b157/annotation_tax.png 295w,\n/static/c7a4a9afe910c9d017d2ae8a816ca0f5/6255c/annotation_tax.png 590w,\n/static/c7a4a9afe910c9d017d2ae8a816ca0f5/db618/annotation_tax.png 752w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p>Using these measures, the authors find that the mean annotation tax for each\nbug is: 1.7 tokens and 231 seconds for Flow, and 2.4 tokens and 306 seconds for TypeScript.</p>\n<p>The authors note this discrepency is largely due to Flow’s paradigm of strong type inference,\nand a more compact syntax for nullable types.
