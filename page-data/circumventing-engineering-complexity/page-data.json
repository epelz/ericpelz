At Asana…","html":"<h2>Examples from building Custom Fields at Asana</h2>\n<p>Having simple code has a big impact on the velocity you can write code and how\nenjoyable it is to do it. At Asana, one of our engineering values is to\n<a href=\"https://blog.asana.com/2016/05/asana-engineering-values/\">strive for simplicity</a>.\nMost of the time, we talk about this in the context of\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/building-asana/designing-simpler-react-components-13a0061afd16\">engineering design</a>.\nBut simplicity is also a crucial guiding principle when making product\ndecisions.</p>\n<p>Engineers often try to solve hard problems — and enjoy doing so. But it’s even\nbetter to avoid the hard problem altogether. Last year, we released\n<a href=\"https://blog.asana.com/2016/09/track-anything-with-custom-fields/\">Custom Fields</a>,\na powerful feature that integrated across Asana. As a result, it had the\npotential to introduce new or magnify existing complexity. Rather than choosing\nthe least complex engineering decision available, we strived to avoid the\ncomplexity entirely.</p>\n<p>In this post, we’ll talk about a few examples from Custom Fields where product\ncomplexity influenced engineering. For each case, we sought to circumvent\ncomplexity, and came up with a few learnings.</p>\n<h3>What are Custom Fields?</h3>\n<p>First, a little background on Custom Fields. One of our first internal use cases\nwas group boba tea ordering. We have an Asana project which we use when we order\nBoba as a group, where anyone can create a task for their drink order.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 579px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0897026ab3bc27a4fa6179e330537fb9/c08bc/1_manage_custom_fields.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 57.432432432432435%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAIAAADwazoUAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABFElEQVQoz4VSi26DMAzk/39urbZWmzTUrWJVeYVCiAkkJDsnCHVtt52cgGyfzzYkzrn39LDbvz1tnj8+jy/71zQ9ZNlps93leem9R4K/A5zzPCd4GGN+ZLiFgPDEMDHhBkhIcOpadJ00xoZ6ztp5GLRSBNN6hAGPxD0rg1mWVdvJ1StlDwJo/hfEfpkMnZuS8DDGkWgI0OM03ZdgclFU57xAXmQCfa8kDneu8EAj1toHZBzE2rZbwyinaMCesCs0H29E0We42bDLhVzVIvs6XU8IQfQbDe3zPWgi4neCU+MLLORekWguyL9SJijG8n8gzlxi203TCnGJZMwLhTgzDw81Igwf/BTa0rzt+DOsWMX/BdK+Adj8g5lc0+izAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"1 manage custom fields\"\n        title=\"1 manage custom fields\"\n        src=\"/static/0897026ab3bc27a4fa6179e330537fb9/c08bc/1_manage_custom_fields.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0897026ab3bc27a4fa6179e330537fb9/12f09/1_manage_custom_fields.png 148w,\n/static/0897026ab3bc27a4fa6179e330537fb9/e4a3f/1_manage_custom_fields.png 295w,\n/static/0897026ab3bc27a4fa6179e330537fb9/c08bc/1_manage_custom_fields.png 579w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 579px) 100vw, 579px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>To have this working, first you need to create Custom Fields.

The project is set\nup with Custom Fields to be compatible with a desired workflow. Projects can\nhave multiple Custom Fields and fields can be shared across projects. These\nCustom Fields act like native Asana fields and work throughout the application.</p>\n<h3>Restrain existing product complexity</h3>\n<p>Custom Fields is a premium feature, which means we had to gate the feature\nbehind premium checks. We ended up spending about 9 engineer weeks to gate the\nfeature to premium in the time leading to our launch.</p>\n<p>The root issue here is that our data model has a lot of variations and Custom\nFields has a lot of touch points. Due to some historic reasons I won’t dive into\nin this post, we have to check many aspects of the data model to determine if a\nuser can use Custom Fields. The ideal outcome would be to simplify the premium\nmodel itself, but that wasn’t tractable given our launch plan and other ongoing\nprojects.</p>\n<h4>Our Solution: Buffer the complexity with a module</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/13b76f46ab73b24a5a7f50efaad66fc2/d7413/3_buffer_complexity.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 26.351351351351354%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAFABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIF/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAd2RLC//xAAXEAEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIh/9oACAEBAAEFAk5nKRf/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/AT//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEf/aAAgBAgEBPwGn/8QAGBAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABExAiH/2gAIAQEABj8Cp3TKz//EABgQAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESFR/9oACAEBAAE/IUUDH209YEOx/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABD8D//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBEP/aAAgBAwEBPxAi5//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQ/9oACAECAQE/EEE//8QAGBABAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITH/2gAIAQEAAT8QfgnAGTsDMsCpW2V9Sp//2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"3 buffer complexity\"\n        title=\"3 buffer complexity\"\n        src=\"/static/13b76f46ab73b24a5a7f50efaad66fc2/1c72d/3_buffer_complexity.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/13b76f46ab73b24a5a7f50efaad66fc2/a80bd/3_buffer_complexity.jpg 148w,\n/static/13b76f46ab73b24a5a7f50efaad66fc2/1c91a/3_buffer_complexity.jpg 295w,\n/static/13b76f46ab73b24a5a7f50efaad66fc2/1c72d/3_buffer_complexity.jpg 590w,\n/static/13b76f46ab73b24a5a7f50efaad66fc2/d7413/3_buffer_complexity.jpg 811w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><em>Pure functions like calculatePermissions can buffer old data model complexity into a simple enum.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We distilled the possible states into an enum, and then built pure helper\nfunctions to handle the thorns in the data model. This meant that our\napplication code only needed to know the state of one enum. This buffered the\ncomplexity resulting from the data model into one module, rather than everywhere\nin the product.</p>\n<h4>Lesson: If complexity exists, constrain it to one place</h4>\n<p>If complexity already exists in the data model or app code, constrain it to one\nplace rather than having it extend to all touch points of your new feature. If\nthe API buffering this complexity is strong, then usages only need to concern\nthemselves with one concept, rather than many.</p>\n<h4>Lesson: Be sure the product is intuitive from the onset</h4>\n<p>Existing product complexity is hard to remove, especially when ingrained in the\ndata model. Future changes need to cope with the complexity and create\nworkarounds or abstractions around it.</p>\n<p>Be sure the product and data model is intuitive and understandable from the\nonset to avoid complexity. If you’re pushing towards a launch and want to be\nscrappy, step back and think about how the code will end up over the next year.</p>\n<p>Note: Since then, our Monetization Team simplified and standardized premium\nchecks moving forward!</p>\n<h3>Reduce surface area</h3>\n<p>What if a task moves to a different project?</p>\n<p>Custom fields must be on a project before any tasks can use them. If a user\nmoves a task to a different project, then it no longer inherits those Custom\nFields.</p>\n<p>What do we do with the data already on those tasks?</p>\n<h4>Initial Plan: Incorporate Custom Fields in all project actions</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 461px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/468ff9e12b9161f0d12ba36033d5de0d/f816d/4_initial_plan.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 37.16216216216216%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAHCAIAAACHqfpvAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAA8klEQVQY041PW07DMBDMgcq9uA3f3AM+uAJ8FgnUQpsnbdqmaR5+ZNdeM0lBFYgPRuOVvdrZGUdE9L6KV+tkHae4pFmRFx9plqMDvi6Wh0MV/gKEETN7EZ5ATNYOSpvx4cYyEBljtTZK675HMQAuMkkgpnK3PxsmaZ4kGQyzvNhsS7Btu65XSmkUaIxSbC32BRGaxOy9eJyfQMc59yuqD8HKSJbv2Nba06n5YtNUx/pY18iPaWxB0cRlb/RANy+bq/vn2d38+jEWx9F5vR+tLp5TkIshi1iHVniq1O3bHnzYth6xO3zqf8AcaRUGAzqjIfwERWGOgnphuM4AAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"4 initial plan\"\n        title=\"4 initial plan\"\n        src=\"/static/468ff9e12b9161f0d12ba36033d5de0d/f816d/4_initial_plan.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/468ff9e12b9161f0d12ba36033d5de0d/12f09/4_initial_plan.png 148w,\n/static/468ff9e12b9161f0d12ba36033d5de0d/e4a3f/4_initial_plan.png 295w,\n/static/468ff9e12b9161f0d12ba36033d5de0d/f816d/4_initial_plan.png 461w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><em>An interstitial dialog to warn the user about custom field ramifications from their action, part of the initial product spec.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The initial product spec was to clear values from tasks if they no longer have\nfields bestowed onto them. Since this is a destructive action, we would prompt\nthe user and explain what is happening.</p>\n<p>In the product, there are many ways to trigger this state: moving tasks between\nprojects, access control changes, and more. We would need to add this warning\nthroughout the entire product for each of these cases, including mobile and the\nAPI! Additionally, removing custom field values on every task is a\nnearly-unbounded amount of work for database and search indexing.</p>\n<p>So we decided to take a step back and think. With the product manager and\ndesigner, we went back to the original goals and motivations. The root cause\nhere is that the action the user is trying to take — removing projects or\nchanging project permissions — isn’t related to Custom Fields. They might not\neven know what a Custom Field is! What if we could divorce the concept of custom\nfield values from project actions? Not only does this align with the user’s\nmental model, but it is simpler.</p>\n<h4>Our Solution: Divorce custom field values from project actions</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3230a660ac7c9c75b7c70c540009a159/307e7/5_orphaned_fields.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.05405405405405%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAIAAADwazoUAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAA9UlEQVQoz2P49+//569fnz57/ufPn/+kgH///jH8+///2/cfL1+++v37N0QIaBxx6B8DxJg/f/7+/Pnr/fsPHz5+IsFmIPX3379v379///EDqPnbt++kaQbZ/Pfvr1+/P3789O3bN9I0A6nPX76AbP7w8cfPnyRo/vv3L1jz1y9fv71+/ebd+/dAzwPtB4Ubkc4GccB8oOc/fPwIDDigoXh0AmWBPmXYf/DIpi07lq1Yu27Dlg2btt+8dYeYCPvz9x9QP0NgWJyDm7+bd4i7T6iKtmlTazdQ8+/ff4jyc2ZuSXBEQnRCBpC0sHWfPmsexFXEaAYAySNxLTzgJtIAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"5 orphaned fields\"\n        title=\"5 orphaned fields\"\n        src=\"/static/3230a660ac7c9c75b7c70c540009a159/fcda8/5_orphaned_fields.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3230a660ac7c9c75b7c70c540009a159/12f09/5_orphaned_fields.png 148w,\n/static/3230a660ac7c9c75b7c70c540009a159/e4a3f/5_orphaned_fields.png 295w,\n/static/3230a660ac7c9c75b7c70c540009a159/fcda8/5_orphaned_fields.png 590w,\n/static/3230a660ac7c9c75b7c70c540009a159/efc66/5_orphaned_fields.png 885w,\n/static/3230a660ac7c9c75b7c70c540009a159/c83ae/5_orphaned_fields.png 1180w,\n/static/3230a660ac7c9c75b7c70c540009a159/307e7/5_orphaned_fields.png 1354w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><em>“Orphaned” custom fields are disabled in the UI, and no longer conferred to new tasks.

The data is still there and we have a helpful message explaining why\nthe field is disabled, how to restore the old behavior, and how to clear out the\ndata.</p>\n<h4>Lesson: Reduce number of concepts code is aware of</h4>\n<p>Why is this better?</p>\n<p>We took the initial scope of this change — throughout the entire application and\nhaving stability concerns — and moved it to a single component. Other actions,\nlike adjusting project permissions, do not need to know about Custom Fields or\nsubtleties in its data model.</p>\n<p>This removed the need for complexity, so we didn’t have to think up any clever\nsolution or algorithm. Instead, we adjusted render behavior in one place.</p>\n<h4>Lesson: Complexity is a barometer for how risky something will be</h4>\n<p>The incentive structure worked in our favor: our solution was faster and easier\nto build. This is because more “thorns” in the product plan likely mean more\nroadblocks or edge-cases to consider.</p>\n<p>So treat complexity as a barometer for how risky something will be.</p>\n<h3>Protect users from costly changes</h3>\n<p>Let’s talk about one more example from building Custom Fields.</p>\n<p>Custom Fields are shared across projects, and are editable.What happens if you\nedit a custom field dropdown and remove an option after others have used it?</p>\n<p>When we discussed this on our team, we had similar trade-offs as with orphaned\nvalues. One option was to clear out data on all tasks that used the custom field\nand pretend the option never existed.</p>\n<h4>Our Solution: Reduce propagation of changes from a single action</h4>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/608ca67f54be10b7155ed4cbb46adcbe/307e7/6_archived_fields.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 41.21621621621622%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAICAIAAAB2/0i6AAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAh0lEQVQY05WQXRJCIQiF7/53WK2griYqPyqjRvXUU8rADMzwwZlzjDFYyuV6y4hzThvnWtjmYdV7L7XW1kqpRDzeMRfyA9uZpiqlxJhCgL3P1qlqawoxpYyLyn8+m27/hADRFO3BSJwzAkRE2paNLEiEiObZ18IN2BgWYZbTeef8/XGaC3/hF1Ye2XGNWMoRAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"6 archived fields\"\n        title=\"6 archived fields\"\n        src=\"/static/608ca67f54be10b7155ed4cbb46adcbe/fcda8/6_archived_fields.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/608ca67f54be10b7155ed4cbb46adcbe/12f09/6_archived_fields.png 148w,\n/static/608ca67f54be10b7155ed4cbb46adcbe/e4a3f/6_archived_fields.png 295w,\n/static/608ca67f54be10b7155ed4cbb46adcbe/fcda8/6_archived_fields.png 590w,\n/static/608ca67f54be10b7155ed4cbb46adcbe/efc66/6_archived_fields.png 885w,\n/static/608ca67f54be10b7155ed4cbb46adcbe/c83ae/6_archived_fields.png 1180w,\n/static/608ca67f54be10b7155ed4cbb46adcbe/307e7/6_archived_fields.png 1354w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><em>Archived dropdown options are annotated in the UI, and existing data is retained. New tasks cannot use archived options.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Instead, we went back to the product goals and came up with an alternative\nsolution: to strikethrough archived options and not let new values be set to it.\nIn other words, keep the data on existing tasks, and exclude it from new entry\npoints. If you re-create an option with the same name, we resurrect the old\noption and its values.</p>\n<h4>Lesson: Protect users from unbounded work</h4>\n<p>The initial solution of iterating on every task would have caused an unbounded\namount of work, presenting a stability concern.</p>\n<p>Further, this would have been a slow and asynchronous action. On the product\nside, we would need to support an intermediate in-progress state wherever we\nshowed Custom Fields. This would have spread the complexity throughout the app\nand added even more work.</p>\n<h4>Lesson: Protect users from sharp edges</h4>\n<p>The initial implementation might also have led to some unhappy users. Since\nCustom Fields are shared across a domain, editing dropdown fields would lead to\nperceived data loss for other users of those fields. If two teams use the same\ncustom field, and one makes a change, then the other team would be surprised to\nsee their data vanish!</p>\n<p>As a result, we would have needed to build on to this — adding undo support,\nnotifications on what happened, or other tweaks. So our solution also led to\nless complexity and surface area down the road.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>These are a few examples of ways we thought about complexity when building\nCustom Fields. A couple of small product considerations and tweaks led to a huge\nimpact on implementation time and simplicity. Our key takeaway is that when\nyou’re working on product features, it’s often best to consider ways to\ncircumvent the complexity, rather than adapting to it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Originally published at\n<a href=\"https://blog.asana.com/2017/09/circumventing-engineering-complexity-examples-from-asana/\">blog.asana.com</a>\non September 11, 2017.</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Circumventing engineering complexity","date":"September 11, 2017","description":"Examples from building Custom Fields at Asana."},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"8 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/circumventing-engineering-complexity/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/propel-new-engineers-code-review/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to propel new engineers with code review"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-best-product-engineering-teams-max-value/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How the best product engineering teams maximize value"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2098522439","63159454"]}
