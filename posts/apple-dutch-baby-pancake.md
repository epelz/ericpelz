I've made a few iterations of Dutch Baby Pancakes over the past few years, trying to get the perfect light-and-fluffy pillowy texture.
About a year ago, I tried adding apples to the mix, and wanted to avoid making the pancake dense. Inspired by a few recipes ([smitten kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/03/extra-billowy-dutch-baby-pancake/), [spruce eats](https://www.thespruceeats.com/apple-dutch-baby-apple-oven-pancake-3058788), and [serious eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/04/dutch-baby-pancake-recipe.html)), this is my go-to for a sweet brunch treat.

Enjoy! You probably don't need to serve this with anything, since it's plenty sweet.
